# GitHub Throwdown

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Bit of a touch up with custom state management using **Context API** and **Hooks**. For simple styling I have used **React Semantic UI**. File stucture of this project is shown below and the code is pretty much self explainatory.<br/>

Make sure to check out my other project in my Code Sandbox. [Simple Form App Using Redux](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/chinthy217/SmashTaps)
